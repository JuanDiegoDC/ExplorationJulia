# My first steps with Julia

### Please check out this amazing project at: https://julialang.org/

### In this repo you will find:
- my solutions to Chris Rackauckas' ["A Deep Introduction to Julia for Data Science and Scientific Computing"](http://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/)
- an implementation of the Simulated Annealing Algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem

*Apologies for the lack of documentation...*
